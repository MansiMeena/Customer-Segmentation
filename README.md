# Random-Forest-Algorithm-for-Customer-Segmentation-based-on-US Census Data

Random Forest Algorithm was applied to US Census data to segment customers based on their Income Levels

The algorithm was applied on 16,000+ rows of data with 14 attributes (mix of qualitative and quantitative factors). 
The model's predictive accuracy on test set (20% randomly chosen data from dataset) is around 85%.
